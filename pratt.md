# Pratt Parser


This implements Pratt's parser algorithm. The main interest over other presentations of Pratt's
algorithm presented elsewhere, for example Andy Chu's one, is that I've added some error handling.
The error handling could be used to implement Stroustrups'
[whitespace overloading](https://www.stroustrup.com/whitespace98.pdf).
